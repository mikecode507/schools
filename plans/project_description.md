Project Details

This website, branded "Mi Mejor Retrato," is specifically designed for "Sabis 2026." It showcases a portfolio, pricing, service packages, and contact information. The architecture centers around a responsive design for optimal viewing on any device.

Detailing Project Architecture

The website leverages a client-side structure, with HTML for content structuring and sections like a gallery and contact form. CSS files, including testing-style.css, index.css, and style.css, handle styling. JavaScript dynamically loads modular components like bio and footer. The content is designed to be responsive.

Providing Project Description/Architecture

The project is a static website proposal under the "Mi Mejor Retrato" brand specifically for "Sabis 2026", showcasing a portfolio pulled from an AWS S3 bucket. Service packages are also dynamically loaded. The architecture is client-side, with HTML for content structuring. CSS files like testing-style.css and style.css manage the styling. There is also embedded javascript to handle the image gallery from S3, and to handle form submissions and loading component files like bio.html.

Delivering Project Information

The proposal is for a static website, "Mi Mejor Retrato," offering school photography for "Sabis 2026." The project description covers portfolio images from an S3 bucket, pricing (dynamically loaded from JSON), workflow, and a contact form. The client-side architecture uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm now updating the to-do list to reflect its completion.
